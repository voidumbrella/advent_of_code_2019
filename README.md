# Advent of Code 2019
I'm using this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) as an
opportunity to learn Rust from the scratch.

This uses the [cargo-aoc](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc) library.
To solve a puzzle, run
```bash
cargo aoc [-d day] [-p part]
```

The tests can be ran with
```bash
cargo test
```

or 
```bash
cargo test day##
```
to run tests for a specific day, where ## is a two digit number for the date.
